Qwen, please explore the entire project folder that I have in VS Code without making any changes. Your task is to check and confirm:

Whether the index.html file exists at the root of the project folder that is being served by Live Server.

Whether other HTML files (like about.html and contact.html) are in subfolders or in the root.

If the folder structure is such that opening the root URL (http://172.20.10.3:5500/) on a device would cause a directory listing instead of loading index.html.

Report back clearly whether the current file locations and folder structure are correct for proper Live Server functionality.

Do not modify or move any files. Just analyze and provide a detailed confirmation so we can plan the fix.

when you're done document inside changelog.md everything you did and stop
